        <p ><b> I have completed master's degree in applied mathematics recently from the University of Waterloo.
        My Research focus was scientific computation. I've developed couple of smart algorithm for different PDEs simulations.
        Computer programming and problem solving is my passion. I am also very interested in different machine learning algorithms and their applicatons.
        I worked on different computer vision, natural language processing, data analytics problems. Currently I am working on
        different exciting problems such as machine translation, smart chatbot, efficient SSD algorithm. I love to stay tuned with 
        latest technology and I have quick learning ability. So, I used these abilities to accomplish my goal with highest level of perfection.
        I firmly believe machine learning and IT industry is evolving rapidly. I am  well prepared to adapt with this evolution.
